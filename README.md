# Movie Recommender System ðŸŽ¥
This is a content-based movie recommender system built using Python, Pandas, and Streamlit, and it leverages The Movie Database (TMDB) dataset. The system recommends movies similar to the selected one based on features like movie genre, overview, and keywords.

## Features
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies based on the similarity of content features (e.g., genres, plot keywords, movie overviews).
TMDB API Integration: Fetches movie posters and additional details using the TMDB API.
Interactive Frontend: Utilizes Streamlit for an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making it easy to get movie recommendations.
#### Dataset
The project uses a cleaned dataset from TMDB.
The dataset includes information like movie titles, genres, overviews, and keywords that are essential for building the recommender system.
How It Works
#### Data Preprocessing:
Movies are represented using features like genres, keywords, and overviews.
Vectorization techniques (like TF-IDF or cosine similarity) are applied to find the similarity between movies.
#### Recommendation Algorithm:
When a user selects a movie, the system computes similarity scores and displays the top 5 recommended movies.
TMDB API for Posters:
The movie posters are fetched from the TMDB API using movie IDs.
